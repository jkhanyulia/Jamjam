# The goal is to create a simple match 3 game using Python and Pygame.
# The game will feature a grid of colored emogis that the player can swap to create matches of three or more.
# The game will include basic mechanics such as swapping, matching, and clearing matched emogis.
# The game will also have a scoring system and a simple user interface.
# The game will use only standard libraries and Pygame for graphics and input handling.
# The game will be designed to be easily extendable for future features.
# The game will utilise five different colored emogis for variety.
